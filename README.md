# DeepLearning_Project10
This github repository contains the poster, data, and code used for the project completed for DTU's course 02456 Deep Learning. The project was focused on car segmentation and U-Net as well and DeepLabv3+ models were investigated for this. 

In order to provide a prof of code, sample data has been uploaded, however due to the fact that all data will be available, 4 changes have to be made to the code in order for it to work. The test_list and train_list much chnaged to the outcommented list. 
The sample data have 7 test images, 15 real images and 30 augmented images. Using this data will not provide as good results, but it will show that the code is executable
