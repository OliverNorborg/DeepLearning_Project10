# DeepLearning_Project10
This github repository contains the poster, data, and code used for the project completed for DTU's course 02456 Deep Learning. The project was focused on car segmentation and Unet as well and deeplabv3+ models were investigated for this. 

In order to provide a proff of code, sample data has been uploaded, however due to the fact that all data will be avilable, 4 changes have to be made to the code in order for it to work. The test_list and train_list much chnaged to the outcommented list. 
The sample data have 7 test images, 15 real images and 30 augmented images. Using this data will not provide as good results, but it will show that the code is able to run as it was with all of the available data
